# Fraud Detection with Supervised Learning with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
This is a walk through on the following research paper analyzing various machinelearning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Na√Øve Bayes (NB) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in order to determine which algorithm is most suitable for credit card fraud detection. 

By replicating the steps from the study, it sought to demonstrate my relevant skills and knowledge on solving the problem. The dataset is enclosed as 'creditcard.csv', which is a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) containing 284,807 European credit card transactions with 492 fraudulent transactions that occurred over two days in September 2013.
