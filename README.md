# Credit Card Fraud Detection – Supervised Learning (Portfolio Project)

## Project Summary
Detecting costly credit card fraud using supervised machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, MLP) and SMOTE for class imbalance. Results benchmarked against published peer-reviewed study. Clear business context, actionable results, and model interpretability highlighted.

## Dataset
[Kaggle European credit card transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), anonymized for privacy. Highly imbalanced (284,807 transactions; 492 fraud).

## Key Results
- Best model: [X] (highest recall/precision, lowest FP rate)
- Feature importance: [Top drivers]
- ROC AUC: [Value]; PR AUC: [Value]

## Business Impact
Emphasizes cost savings, risk compliance, and importance of recall over accuracy for operational fraud detection.

## Next Steps
- Try insurance/open banking datasets
- Integrate explainability tools (SHAP)
- Simulate cost/benefit of thresholds
